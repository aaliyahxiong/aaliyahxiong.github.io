				<p>As I was preparing to study abroad in South Korea last year, I had spent a lot of time trying to gather more information about the country to better prepare myself for when I arrived. While I had bookmarked certain places to go and had been exposed to various content online about others' experiences travelling, I wish I had a single spot that encapsulated everything I needed to know about living in South Korea. This site is that. A basis for anyone interested in going abroad that carries my advice from someone who was just there quite recently.</p>
