			<p>The navigation apps I reccomend are Naver Maps and Kakao Maps as Google Maps is not as accurate in South Korea. I will be focusing on 3 forms of transportation. T-money cards are the tranportation cards needed in Korea and these can be bought at the convenience store.</p>
			<ul>
                <li>Subway</li>
                <li>Bus</li>
                <li>KTX</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Subway</h2>

            	<p>Subways are extremely easy to use and the most efficient form of transportation in Korea. There are signs written in English and announcements made in 3 languages: Korean, Japanese, and English. There are directions and arrows everywhere to direct you to the right stop.</p>

            <h2>Bus</h2>
            <img src="images\bus.jpeg" alt="bus" width="250" height="200">
            	<p>Buses are also very easy to navigate but I did use the bus less often than subways. There are also night buses that run hourly after 12am. The cost for buses are slightly less than subways but night buses cost about the same which is 1,400 won.</p>

		<h2>Train</h2>
            <img src="images\train.jpeg" alt="subway" width="300" height="200">
            	<p>These trains are long distance and go across the country. I used the train when I went from Seoul to Busan and the tickets can be bought online. Tickets are also relatively inexpensive as well.</p>
