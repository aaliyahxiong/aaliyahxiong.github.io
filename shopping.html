    <h2>Shopping</h2>
    <p>There are so so so many places to shop in Korea. Malls are where I would recommend for higher and luxury brands, but there are different areas known for shopping.</p>

    <article class="right-aligned">
      <h3>Seongsu</h3>
      <p>This area is popular for holding various pop-up stores for a multitude of brands. This is very popular for their shoe street as well, but this area is most known for its shopping and cafes.</p>

         <h3>Hongdae</h3>
      <p>This area is very well known and fun to shop at as there are stores everywhere but I find it to be a little overwhelming. It does have everything though, so I would reccomend this place because of its variety of brands and shopping.</p>
